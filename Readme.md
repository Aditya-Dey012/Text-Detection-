This project leverages the powerful synergy of OpenCV and Pytesseract to create a versatile Text Detection system capable of converting both images and videos into machine-readable text. OpenCV plays a pivotal role in preprocessing tasks, applying image transformations, and enhancing the quality of textual content within images and video frames.

In the context of images, the system excels at accurately identifying and extracting text, providing a seamless solution for tasks such as document analysis, OCR-based document digitization, and image-based data retrieval. The integration with Pytesseract, a Python wrapper for the Tesseract-OCR engine, ensures robust text recognition, even in challenging scenarios.

Extending its capability to videos, the system processes frames in real-time, enabling dynamic text extraction from video streams. This functionality opens up possibilities for applications in video indexing, content moderation, and video analytics where textual information needs to be extracted and analyzed.

This Text Detection system showcases the potential of combining computer vision techniques with OCR technologies, making it a valuable tool for tasks that require the conversion of visual information into textual data across both static images and dynamic video content.
